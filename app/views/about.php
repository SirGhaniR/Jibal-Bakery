      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We three founded this bakery because of our love for bread, cookies,
        cakes, and pastries. From hobby to creation, we want to bring warm,
        soft, and addictive flavors to accompany every sweet moment of yours.

          <h3>From Kitchen to Community</h3>
          <p>
            It all started in a small home kitchen where three friends discovered
            their shared passion for baking. What began as weekend experiments
            and neighborhood potlucks quickly grew into something special.
          </p>
          <p>
            After countless trials, perfecting recipes, and gathering feedback
            from our first "customers" (our families and friends), we decided
            to turn our love for baking into a business. Jibal Bakery was born
            with a simple mission: to create exceptional baked goods that bring
            joy to every bite.
